# deep_rl_project
This project improves on a Reinforcement Learning algorithm developed by Google's DeepMind.
Tech stack used to implement this on lab servers - Python (PyTorch, CUDA, NumPy), Docker

## Reinforcement Learning (RL) Algorithm
The RL algorithm is originally made by DeepMind titles Value-Decomposition Networks For Cooperative Multi-Agent Learning
